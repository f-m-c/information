# Metamodel

The FMC metamodel depicts the atomic concepts and their relations which are necessary to describe software-intensive systems using FMC. However, it neither defines the syntax of the different types of FMC diagrams nor the relationships between FMC diagrams on different levels of abstractions. The explaned metamodel is also available as [download (88.29kB)](../assets/download/metamodel/FMC-Metamodel_Explained.pdf) as well as the [FMC metamodel diagram (28.65kB)](../assets/download/metamodel/FMC-Metamodel.pdf).
